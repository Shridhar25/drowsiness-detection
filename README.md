DROWSINESS DETECTION 

The aim of this project is to develop a drowsiness detection system by monitoring the eyes; it is believed that the symptoms of fatigue can be detected early enough to avoid sleep to achieve targets. In such a case when drowsiness is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the person. This detection system provides a noncontact technique for judging different levels of alertness and facilitates early detection of a decline in alertness. In such a case when fatigue is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the person.

To design an alerting system for the students this will use real time video of a person to capture the drowsiness level if feeling fatigue. A chrome extension is designed which if enabled, will start the webcam and track the person. The frame per second (FPS) will be set and an alert will be generated if a continuous set of frames are detected as drowsy. The conventional methods cannot capture complex expressions, however with the origin of Deep learning models a substantial research is done on detection of states of a person in real time. The system works adequately under the natural lighting conditions and no matter the use of any accessories like cap, glasses, etc. The system is implemented using YOLOv5 models (You look only once) which is an extremely fast and accurate detection model.
